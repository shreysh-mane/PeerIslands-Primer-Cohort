1. Temperature Converter Program
a. Take input from the user for the temperature value and the scale (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
b. Based on the user's input, determine whether to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit or from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
c. Use arrow functions to perform the conversion. (Create two separate arrow functions: one for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, and another for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius. Pass the temperature value to the appropriate function from your main function and return the converted value.)
d. Display the converted temperature value to the user.

2. Calculator programme.
 a. Take input from user which operation he wants to perform. ("sum", "minus", "Mul")
 b. based on his input take the next 2 numbers.
 c. to perform the operation use arrow function. (for sum operation create a sum arrow function and pass 2 values to it form your main funciton and return the sum to your main function. and then console log it.)


3. Print the factorial of the number which is given by user.

 <!-- Task Array -->

1. Find number 2 in the following array. If 2 is present, print its index in the array. If 2 is not present, display the message "Element not found in array".
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];


2. Remove "apple" from the following array:
const fruits = ["banana", "mango", "apple", "kiwi"];


3. Reverse the order of the elements in the following array:
const numbers = [23, 45, 12, 67, 89, 34];


4. Find the maximum value in the following array:
const numbers = [23, 45, 12, 67, 89, 34];

5. Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the second-largest number in the array:
const numbers = [10, 5, 8, 20, 15, 12];


6. Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
